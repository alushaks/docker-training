# Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily develop, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and encapsulate everything needed to run an application, including libraries and dependencies.

## Benefits of Docker

- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring consistency from development to production.
  
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host operating system kernel, making them lightweight and fast to start up.
  
- **Scalability**: Docker makes it simple to scale applications horizontally by running multiple instances of a service.

## Installation

### Installing Docker

To get started with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Platform**: Docker supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to download Docker Desktop or Docker Engine for your operating system.
  
2. **Installation Instructions**: Follow the installation instructions provided by Docker for your specific platform. These instructions typically involve downloading an installer and running it to install Docker.

3. **Verify Installation**: Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run `docker --version` to verify that Docker has been installed correctly.

## Your First Docker Container
